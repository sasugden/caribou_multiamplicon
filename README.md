This repository contains supporting material for the manuscript entitled "Endangered deep-snow mountain caribou have a distinct gut microbiome that may be altered by maternal penning," which is currently being prepared for submission. The R code and terminal required to reproduce all analyses and figures is currently available:
+ 01_sequence_processing brings the raw sequencing files into phyloseq objects and performs initial quality filtering.
+ 02_statistical_analysis includes code for all statistical analysis described in the manuscript and supplementary material.
+ 03_figures_tables reproduces all the figures and tables in the manuscript.
+ terminal_scripts includes examples of any code that could not be run in R (e.g., cutadapt, CAZyme annotation).

The sample metadata, including an R workspace with the primary analysis objects, will be made publicly available when the manuscript is accepted or upon reasonable request to the first author (ssugden@ualberta.ca). The original sequencing files have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA1067083.
